This is a full self-driving car simulator based on Computer Vision and [NVIDIA CNN model for Self-driving car](https://github.com/afondiel/full-self-driving-car-simulation/tree/main/doc)

I ran Udacity self-driving car simulator intended for NanoDegree program (for Self-driving Engineer) to collect training data

After training the NVIDIA machine learning model with the collected data I save the model (you can modify the model to increase its accuracy)

Finally I run the simulator in autonomy to clone the self-driving behavior based on the pretrained model but on real time test dataset  

# Requirements tools

- python3
- [Udacity self-driving car simulator download repo](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)

- opencv
# Libraries

Install the required libaries by running the script below 
- on linux
```bash
./run_setup.sh
```

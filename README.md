# full-self-driving-car-simulation

## Over view

This is a full self-driving car simulator based on Computer Vision. 
I used Udacity self-driving car simulator intended for NanoDegree program (for Self-driving Engineer) to collect training data
then used NVIDIA machine learning model to train the datasets and finally replay the simulator besed on the model cloning behaviour.
